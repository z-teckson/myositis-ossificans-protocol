# Myositis Ossificans Treatment Protocol (v1.1)

## 1. Diagnosis
- **Clinical suspicion:** Based on patient history of trauma and presentation of a painful, firm mass in soft tissue.
- **Imaging:** Initial X-ray. Advanced imaging with CT or MRI recommended to characterize the lesion and differentiate from soft tissue sarcoma. A "zonal phenomenon" on MRI is a key diagnostic feature.
- **Biopsy:** Generally not recommended unless diagnosis is uncertain after imaging.

## 2. Conservative Management (Initial Phase)
- **Rest & Activity Modification:** Limit range of motion to prevent exacerbation.
- **Medication:** NSAIDs for pain and inflammation. Consider oral steroids (e.g., Prednisone 40mg/day for 2 weeks) in the early inflammatory phase to reduce heterotopic bone formation.
- **Adjunctive Therapy:** Consider bisphosphonates (e.g., Etidronate) to inhibit bone mineralization in the early active phase.

## 3. Surgical Intervention
- **Indication:** Reserved for cases with significant functional impairment, persistent pain, or nerve compression after the lesion has matured.
- **Timing:** Surgery should be delayed until the lesion is radiographically mature (typically 6-12 months after onset) to minimize recurrence.
- **Procedure:** Marginal excision of the mature bone mass.
